# SpringBoot-Auth0-ThymeLeaf
Auth0 with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf

This is a more complete example of using Auth0 with Spring Boot.

This example is setup to support Thymeleaf instead of JSP and it will also redirect back to the original link you used to access the site intstead of always redirecting back to the site root homepage.
